# DemandForecast

This repository contains a synthetic dataset `OrangeJuiceX25.csv` and prototype code for demand forecasting models.

## Dataset

`data/OrangeJuiceX25.csv` simulates weekly sales of multiple orange juice brands across several stores. Each row records the store, brand, week number, eleven price variables, two promotion flags (`deal` and `feat`), and the `sales` target.

Example rows:

```
store,brand,week,price1,price2,price3,price4,price5,price6,price7,price8,price9,price10,price11,deal,feat,sales
1,1,1,3.04,1.04,4.52,1.34,3.35,1.99,1.62,2.6,1.2,1.96,2.67,0,0,109.2
1,1,2,3.83,3.1,3.26,2.78,2.26,3.28,2.12,2.15,3.3,2.97,4.17,1,1,139.4
```

## Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

The script `src/data_ingestion_preprocessing.py` demonstrates how to load the dataset with `pandas`, explore summary statistics, visualize sales distribution and price correlations, and engineer features such as lagged sales and seasonal indicators.

Run it with:

```bash
python src/data_ingestion_preprocessing.py
```

This will print basic dataset information and show a sample of the processed DataFrame.

## Econometric Model Prototypes

The script `src/econometric_models.py` includes prototype implementations for:

- **LASSO Regression per SKU×Store** using rolling windows and `LassoCV`.
- **General-to-Specific (GETS) OLS** with t-ratio pruning.
- **Panel-Wide LASSO** that pools all store-brand data.

Run the script to compute example RMSE values:

```bash
python src/econometric_models.py
```

The code expects that `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels` are available in the environment.

## XGBoost Prototypes

The script `src/xgboost_models.py` implements gradient boosting models using
`xgboost`. Two variants are provided:

- **Per-series XGBoost** tuned on individual store–brand pairs with a small
  hyperparameter grid and a validation split in each rolling window.
- **Pooled XGBoost** that stacks all series and adds store/brand dummy
  variables.

Run it with:

```bash
python src/xgboost_models.py
```

For only the pooled approach, run:

```bash
python src/pooled_xgboost.py
```

These scripts require the `xgboost` package in addition to `pandas` and
`scikit-learn`.

## Transformer Prototype

The script `src/transformer_trt.py` provides a small Transformer
architecture (roughly inspired by the Temporal Fusion Transformer) for
next-week sales prediction.  Because the dataset is fairly small, the
model uses only a couple of self-attention layers and embeds the
`store` and `brand` identifiers.

Run it with:

```bash
python src/transformer_trt.py
```

This script requires `pytorch` in addition to the packages above.
